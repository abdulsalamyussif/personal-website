        This page is designed to inform people <br />
        about the need to have a website in the 21st Century.
      </p>
      <p>I am a <strong>Web developer and a Mathematics Teacher.</strong></p>
      <p>
        I am inviting you to contact me for your personal website. Every Teacher
        needs a website for records, archive and data.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am inviting Schools to as a matter of concern have a website for their
        student records and data base.
